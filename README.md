# * Features
- CASE
- STM32
- Many GPIO pins breakout
- embeded microcontroller
- Has usb c
- Has rtc capabilities
* About the STM32 (STM32F103C8)
- The STMicroelectronics STM32F103C8 is an ARM 32-bit Cortex-M3 Microcontroller, 72MHz, 64kB Flash, 20kB SRAM, PLL, Embedded Internal RC 8MHz and 32kHz, Real-Time Clock, Nested Interrupt Controller, Power Saving Modes, JTAG and SWD, 3 Synch.

* You would now ask why the hell a stm 32 and not a Arduino
- more power
- cheap
- industrial ruged and tuff(tuff as I am)
- More pins and needs less passive components compared to the other processors like Rp2040 or Arduino
